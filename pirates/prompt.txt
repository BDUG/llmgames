Act as a game developer and create a complete single-file HTML/JavaScript 2D “Pirate Game” that includes all of the following requirements:
Overall Structure

HTML Document
Begin with <!DOCTYPE html> and specify the <html lang="en">.
In the <head>, set <meta charset="UTF-8"> and include a <title> such as "Pirate Game – Cities, Trading, Cannons & Boarding".
In the <body>, add:
A floating div (e.g., #keyCommands) to display keyboard controls.
A main <canvas> (e.g., #gameCanvas, 800×600) for rendering.
A scrolling “console” area (e.g., a <div> with id="gameConsole") to show in-game log messages.
Put all the game logic in a single <script> (no external JS files).
Include CSS in either <style> blocks or inline in the HTML <head> to style the canvas, background, and console area.
Console Override
Override console.log so each call also appends messages to the on-screen console <div> (so we see logs in the game’s interface).
Ensure the console auto-scrolls to the bottom with each new line.
Keyboard Controls & UI
Key Commands Box
A floating div in the top-left corner listing controls in bullet points:
In the main menu: press Enter to start the game.
While playing (not trading):
Left/Right Arrows: rotate the player’s ship
Up Arrow: move forward
Space: fire cannons
P: pause/unpause
M: toggle map view
S: save game
L: load game
T: initiate trading (when near a city)
C: capture an enemy ship
While trading:
1,2,3: buy goods
Q,W,E: sell goods
4: buy a cannon
R: recruit crew
V: sell a captured ship
Y: sell a cannon
T: end trading
Game States
The possible states are: "menu", "playing", "paused", and "map".
Start in "menu". Pressing Enter starts the game (switch to "playing").
P toggles pause ("paused" / "playing").
M toggles map mode ("map" / "playing").
While in Trading Mode
Show a trading overlay on top of the main canvas (e.g., a semi-transparent rectangle with text).
The user can buy/sell different goods by pressing keys 1-3 (for buying) or Q/W/E (for selling).
Can also buy/sell cannons, recruit crew, sell captured ships.
Press T again to end trading and place the ship back in the water near the city.
World & Generation
World Dimensions
A large 2D world (e.g., 2400×1600). The canvas is only 800×600, so we need a camera system that centers on the player.
Islands
Randomly generate ~20 islands using polygons (each has a center, radius, and random vertex shape).
Each island should have 2 cities placed on its coastline.
Cities
Each city has:
A name (e.g., "Stadt 1", "Stadt 2", etc.).
A nation (one of "Holland", "Spanien", "Frankreich", "England").
A population with birth rate, death rate, trading activity, and production rates that change the city’s population and goods’ prices slightly over time.
A set of goods (e.g., "Rum", "Spices", "Gold") with dynamic prices.
Make sure each nation has at least one city.
Display a small “house” or building graphic (rectangle + triangular roof) on the map at each city’s coordinates. Also draw a small flag next to the house, whose color depends on the city’s nation.
Camera & Drawing
The camera center is always at the player’s position so the player is in the middle of the canvas.
Only draw the part of the world that is visible in the 800×600 canvas area.
Minimap
In the corner, draw a scaled-down map (e.g., 200×200) showing islands and city positions in miniature, plus a small dot for the player’s location.
Map View
If the player presses M, we switch to a “map” state which shows a full “Caribbean map” that fills the canvas, showing all islands/cities and the player’s position. Pressing M again returns to normal gameplay.
Nations & Relationships
Nations
The four possible nations: "Holland", "Spanien", "Frankreich", and "England".
Keep a data structure for relationships: each pair can be "peace" or "war".
Randomly toggle the relationship between two nations every 20 seconds or so.
If a nation is at war with the player’s nation, its warships will attack the player on sight.
Player & Ship
Initial Player Setup
The player starts near a city of "England" if available, or at a random water position otherwise.
The player ship has:
(x, y) position
angle (rotation)
speed
hp (health)
An inventory of goods
A certain amount of gold (money)
A chosen ship type ("Sloop", "Brig", or "Galleon") each with different max crew and max cannons
Current crew count
Current number of cannons
A size (radius or bounding box used for collisions)
Up arrow moves forward, left/right arrows rotate the angle. Collisions with land or edges of the map are disallowed.
The ship can fire a projectile (cannonball) with the space bar, if in playing mode.
If player hp <= 0, player “dies” and is respawned at the nearest city with a basic "Sloop" ship, 100 gold, 100 HP, 10 crew.
HUD
Display a small text overlay showing:
Player HP
Money
Crew (current / max)
Ship type
Nation
Number of cannons
Enemy Ships
Generation
Generate ~10 enemy ships, each assigned a random nation, one of the three ship types, and a “task” among: "Kriegsschiff", "Handelsschiff", "Colonialschiff".
If the enemy’s nation is at war with the player’s nation, warships will try to engage the player.
Merchant or Colonial ships might just move around or aim for a trade city of their own nation. If attacked, they may fight back.
Each ship has:
(x, y) position, angle, speed, size
hp (health), if reduced to 0 or below, it sinks
A small random “loot” amount of gold
Possibly a “defendTarget” if they’re attacked
A “tradeDestination” if they are a merchant heading to a friendly city
If stuck or not moving, they automatically reposition themselves to a random water location.
Combat
If in range and not in trading mode, warships or defending ships fire cannonballs at the player (with a cooldown).
Cannonballs have a position, angle, speed, damage, and range; they disappear on collision or after traveling a certain distance.
If the player is in the middle of a trade, enemy warships do not attack. (Alternatively, if you want a different rule, you can keep it as in your code.)
Capturing Ships
Capture
If an enemy ship’s HP is below a certain threshold (e.g., 15) and is near the player, pressing C can capture the ship.
Prompt the player if they want to “take over” or “sink” the captured ship. Taking over puts it into an array of “captured ships” that follow the player. Sinking just removes it but grants loot.
Add the captured ship to capturedShips if taken over. Give it some base HP or partial crew. Transfer the loot to the player.
Captured Ships
The player may have a small array of captured ships that follow them.
In the trade interface, the player can sell a captured ship by pressing V. The amount of money gained depends on the captured ship’s type.
Trading System
Trade Initiation
Press T while near a city to open a “trade overlay.” The game is in a “trading” sub-state where movement and combat are paused for the player (and possibly for warships).
Goods
Each city sells three goods with dynamic prices ("Rum", "Spices", "Gold" etc.). Press 1,2,3 to buy, Q,W,E to sell.
Cannons & Crew
Press 4 to buy a cannon; press Y to sell a cannon.
Press R to recruit crew if you have enough money (and if city population is not zero).
Selling Captured Ships
Press V to sell one captured ship at a time for a certain price (depends on the ship type).
End Trade
Press T again to end trading and place the player’s ship back in the water near the city.
Saving & Loading
Key Commands
S to save the current game. Prompt for a save name, store data (player, enemy ships, captured ships, islands, cities) in localStorage.
L to load. Prompt the user to choose from available saves in localStorage, then restore those objects into the game. If a save is invalid or missing, show an error message in the console log.
Menu & Pause Overlays
Menu State
At the start, show a black background with large text: "Sid Meier’s Pirates Clone" or something similar.
Show instructions to press Enter to start, and possibly mention S to save or L to load if you want that in the menu.
Pause Overlay
If in “pause,” render a semi-transparent layer over the canvas with the text "PAUSE" and “Press P to resume.”
Style & Implementation Details
CSS
The body background can be a sky-blue color (#87ceeb) with an 800×600 canvas (#add8e6 for water).
The console <div> beneath the canvas is 800×100, black background, green text, monospace font, scrollable.
JS Organization
All features should be in one <script> block. Use functions for organization (e.g., renderMenu(), drawShip(), updateProjectiles(), etc.).
Make sure the main game loop uses requestAnimationFrame.
Respawn Logic
If the player’s HP hits 0, run a respawnPlayer() function that:
Finds the nearest city
Places the player’s ship near that city
Sets the ship type to “Sloop,” HP to 100, money to 100, crew to 10
Logs a message in the console.
Randomizing Nations
Each city and enemy ship can have a randomly assigned nation from the four possible. Maintain the “peace”/”war” relations. Toggle at random intervals.
Commenting & Logging
Use console.log for important events (e.g., “Player hit for 10 damage,” “Enemy ship sunk,” “Saved game as 'Save1'”).
These logs should appear in the on-screen console <div>.
Please produce a single-file solution that implements all of these details, with descriptive comments in English. The final output should be an HTML file containing all required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it runs as-is in a browser.
